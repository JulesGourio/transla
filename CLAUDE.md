## Independence

LatLang is a fully standalone Databricks App: own FastAPI backend, own React
frontend, own Databricks App and service principal. Both non-dev targets
share ONE UC catalog schema (`uat_landingzone.latlang` for uat/uat-test,
`prod_landingzone.latlang` for prod) — never shared with any other app —
with isolation between the real and disposable-test target coming from a
`_test`-suffixed volume (`latlang` vs `latlang_test`), not a separate
schema. Same pattern for Lakebase: one shared Postgres project id
(`LAKEBASE_PROJECT_ID` in `app.yaml`, an existing compute resource reused
to avoid provisioning a new one) with this app's own dedicated,
`_test`-suffixed database (`latlang`/`latlang_test`) inside it.

See `client/src/components/translate/README.md` for the pipeline
documentation (extract -> audit -> Q&A -> translate -> fit_check -> rebuild
-> validate -> preview) and the Lakebase schema.

## Status (2026-08-23)

Full infra rename from the earlier scaffold name (`qualibot-translate`,
schema shared with a sibling app) to `latlang` (own schema, still shared
between this app's own uat/uat-test targets by design — see Independence
above) done today. The previous `qualibot-translate-uat-test` deployment
was destroyed and cleaned up first — its data (`dnt_rules` 17 rows,
`glossary_terms` 30 rows, everything else empty) was backed up to
`lakebase_backups/` (gitignored, local only) before deletion.

**`latlang-uat` deployed and validated for the first time today**: app
`RUNNING`, schema/volume `uat_landingzone.latlang`/`latlang` created,
Lakebase database `latlang` created cleanly (8 tables), LibreOffice archive
in place, `/` and `/api/*` both healthy. `latlang-uat-test` re-deployed
under the shared-schema design right after (volume `latlang_test` in the
same schema) and revalidated the same way, including one real end-to-end
translation smoke test (EN->FR, `.docx`, via
`TRANSLATE_ENDPOINT=databricks-gpt-5-6-luna` — confirmed working, not just
`READY`). Open items before `latlang-uat` is opened to other users:

- Create the `Role-Project-LEAP-End-users-LatLang` Databricks group (or
  agree on its final name) and uncomment its `CAN_USE` permission in
  `databricks.yml` (currently commented out — CoreAdmin/CoreDev cover
  access in the meantime).
- The LibreOffice archive on both `latlang` and `latlang_test` volumes is
  currently a copy of the sibling app's own archive (`utils/soffice_packaging/
  package_libreoffice.py` was not re-run) — fine for now, but a fully
  independent rebuild is still open if that matters later.
- Decide whether to run a `latlang`-targeted variant of
  `migrate_translation_data_uat_test` (see `databricks.yml`) to seed real
  glossary/DNT data into `latlang` itself — right now only `latlang_test`
  has ever received that historical data, `latlang` starts empty.
- Not yet deployed to `latlang-prod`.
- Only after `latlang-prod` is validated for real too: archive the old
  `Translator/` prototype folder.

**Feedback / history / share (2026-08-24)**: ported from Qualibot and
tested end-to-end on `latlang-uat-test` (`POST /translate/feedback`,
`POST /translate/jobs/{id}/share` + `GET /translate/shared/{token}`, richer
`JobHistory` drawer). Backend code was also synced to `latlang-uat`'s
workspace source folder (needed the `grant_volume_access_job.py` fix above
applied there too) but **the running `latlang-uat` app has NOT been
redeployed** with it — still on its previous snapshot, deploy is a separate
step to confirm explicitly.

**Portuguese + Arabic added as translation/glossary languages (2026-08-24)**:
extended the language set from {EN, FR, ES, DE, CS, BG} to also cover PT and
AR across the whole stack — `TranslateView.tsx` source/target selector,
`langdetect.py` (script-tier for Arabic like BG's Cyrillic check, diacritic
profile for Portuguese's ã/õ), the glossary CRUD (`GlossaryTermIn`/
`GlossaryCandidateApprove` + all SQL in `translate.py`), and the Lakebase
schema itself (`glossary_terms`/`glossary_candidates` gained `pt`/`ar TEXT`
columns via `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` in `lakebase.py`, so
existing `latlang`/`latlang_test` databases pick them up on next app
startup — no manual migration step needed). Deliberately NOT touched: the
one-time Intraqual corpus-import tooling under `utils/glossary/` (`_sql.py`,
`sync_candidates_to_lakebase.py`, `import_reviewed_candidates.py`, etc.) —
that corpus only ever contained the original six languages, so extending
those scripts' language tuples would be speculative with nothing to import.
**Not yet validated end-to-end** (no PT/AR document run through the actual
pipeline) and **not yet deployed** to any target. Two known open risks:
LibreOffice's rendering of Arabic (RTL, complex script shaping) through the
shared/copied `soffice` archive hasn't been checked — the archive may be
missing Arabic font/script support; and `ReviewPanel.tsx`'s side-by-side PDF
view has no RTL-aware layout handling.

**Known bug found while testing (not fixed, out of scope of this change)**:
translated text sometimes stores mojibake for accented characters/curly
apostrophes (e.g. "L'inspection" -> "L�inspection", "brève" ->
"brÃ¨ve") — visible in `translation_segments.translated_text` and the
shared-view/API output. `server/services/llm.py::_fix_mojibake` exists and
runs on the raw LLM response before JSON parsing, but doesn't catch every
case. Needs its own investigation.

**Deploy gotchas (all fixed here, will resurface on the next first deploy
of a new target):**
- `requirements.txt` was missing at repo root — Databricks Apps installs
  from that file, not `pyproject.toml`.
- Never declare `apps.*.resources` (`uc_securable`) in `databricks.yml` —
  Terraform then tries to auto-grant USE CATALOG to `account users`, which
  fails unless the deploying user has catalog MANAGE. Grant the app's own
  SP directly instead via the `grant_volume_access` job
  (`utils/databricks_ops/grant_volume_access_job.py`,
  `run_as=job-runner-sa-uat`) — use the app's `service_principal_client_id`
  (equals `apps get`'s `id` field), NOT `oauth2_app_client_id` (a
  different, unrelated OAuth integration id).
- Declaring a `resources.schemas`/`resources.volumes`/`resources.postgres_projects`
  block for a resource that another bundle (or another *target* of this
  same bundle) already Terraform-manages causes a "already exists" conflict
  at `bundle deploy` — confirmed twice: once against the sibling app's
  `qualibot` schema before this app got its own, and once against the
  `qualibot` Lakebase project itself (removed the `postgres_projects` block
  entirely — it's only ever referenced by id via `LAKEBASE_PROJECT_ID`, not
  bundle-managed here). Same reasoning is why `latlang-uat-test`'s target
  block has no `resources.schemas` — the `latlang` schema is owned by the
  `latlang-uat` target's bundle state; `latlang-uat-test` only references it
  by name (`schema_name: ${var.app_write_schema}`) for its own volume.
- The app's own Lakebase Postgres role does not exist by default —
  `password authentication failed` until one is created:
  `databricks postgres create-role projects/qualibot/branches/production
  --role-id <service_principal_client_id> --json '{"spec": {"identity_type":
  "SERVICE_PRINCIPAL", "postgres_role": "<service_principal_client_id>",
  "auth_method": "LAKEBASE_OAUTH_V1", "membership_roles":
  ["DATABRICKS_SUPERUSER"], "attributes": {"createdb": true}}}'`. Set
  `attributes.createdb: true` up front — `membership_roles:
  ["DATABRICKS_SUPERUSER"]` alone does NOT grant it, and `_ensure_database()`
  then fails at startup with `permission denied to create database` (only
  visible via `databricks apps logs <app>`, not in the deploy result). Other
  working CLI commands: `databricks postgres
  list-roles|delete-role|list-databases|delete-database|update-role
  projects/<id>/branches/<branch>[/...]`. Direct psycopg2 connections to the
  Lakebase Postgres endpoint work too (host from
  `databricks postgres list-endpoints`, port 5432, credential from
  `databricks postgres generate-database-credential`) when a quick data
  dump/backup is needed before a destructive change.
- `utils/deploy/render_target_config_env.py` must write `target_config.env`
  with `newline="\n"` — run from Windows without it, the file gets CRLF, and
  the Linux container's bash bakes a trailing `\r` into every exported value
  (e.g. `LAKEBASE_DATABASE` becomes `latlang_test\r`), silently creating a
  corrupted-name database that then can't be found by its clean name.
- The React frontend (`client/out`, built via `cd client && bun run build`)
  is gitignored, and `bundle deploy`'s sync respects `.gitignore` by
  default — so it never reaches the workspace unless force-included via
  `sync.include` in `databricks.yml` (added: `client/out/**`, same trick
  already used for `target_config.env`). Without it, `server/app.py`'s SPA
  catch-all route never registers (no `client/out` found at startup) and
  the app root 404s with `{"detail":"Not Found"}` even though every `/api/*`
  route works fine — easy to miss since the backend looks fully healthy.
- `LAKEBASE_DATABASE` has no per-target override by default (`app.yaml`'s
  shared default is the real `latlang`) — must be set to `latlang_test` via
  `target_config.env` for uat-test, or `_ensure_database`/`_ensure_schema`
  will create/touch the real database on first startup. Double-check this
  every time a new per-target override is added.
- `grant_volume_access_job.py` used to grant only whichever single
  `volume_permission` was passed (default `WRITE VOLUME`) — an app that also
  needs to *read back* the original upload (rebuild stage) then fails with
  `User does not have READ VOLUME on Volume ...`, and any job created before
  the grant is fixed keeps a permanently NULL `input_volume_path` (the fix
  doesn't retroactively repair already-failed jobs; they must be re-created).
  Fixed 2026-08-24 to always grant both READ and WRITE regardless of the
  parameter (kept only for job-parameter backward compatibility).

**PDF-origin jobs — built, deployed, tested on real documents, then
abandoned (2026-08-24).** Some FI documents exist only as PDF, no `.docx`
source. A parallel native-PDF path was built and deployed to `latlang-uat`:
Phase 1 (`pdf_extract.py`/`pdf_rebuild.py`/`pdf_validate.py`, block-level
`page.get_text('dict')` extraction, PyMuPDF redact+reinsert with autofit
shrink, a vendored DejaVu Sans font since the source PDFs' own fonts are
subsetted embedded TrueType) and Phase 2 (`pdf_ocr.py`, vision-LLM
transcription of text baked into raster images, delivered as a PDF
annotation, never touching pixels). Both phases ran end-to-end against a
real 112-page FI (`FI F7XC535-3PTS-FI02 indice I.pdf`) on `latlang-uat`.

Two real bugs were found and fixed along the way (kept as a lesson, not
because the code survives): (1) `pdf_extract.py` joined every PyMuPDF
*line* in a block with no separator, so a stacked header table (Référence/
Indice/FI/...) rendered as one glued run-on string — fixed by grouping
lines into visual rows by Y-overlap (same row → space, different rows →
`\n`); (2) PyMuPDF's `insert_textbox` draws **nothing at all** when text
doesn't fit at the given size (confirmed with an isolated test) — the
original code just flagged this as "overflow" without a fallback, so ~20%
of segments on a real document silently lost their translation (a blank
box), not just a badly-shrunk one — fixed with a box-expansion + unbounded
last-resort draw so text is never silently dropped.

Even after both fixes, the outcome on this document was judged **not good
enough to ship**: no bold/color/font-family preservation (flat plain text),
no real table-cell alignment (PyMuPDF's block/line grouping doesn't map to
columns), a broken logo glyph, and — the biggest gap — pages where the
actual instructional content lives entirely inside one raster image (common
on "montage" pages in this document) stayed **visually untranslated**
except for a small, easy-to-miss OCR annotation icon. Given the user's own
side-by-side test, Microsoft Word's built-in PDF→docx import produced a
markedly more faithful result on the exact same document (tables/layout
recognized properly) than this from-scratch PyMuPDF reconstruction —
confirming the gap was in the *reconstruction engine*, not something
achievable by iterating further on block-level text placement.

**Decision: PDF upload is no longer accepted.** `.docx` only, again — see
"Independence" and the pipeline stages above; none of this touched the
docx path's own behavior (the PDF work was purely additive/parallel, never
modified inside the `else` branches), so nothing here changes for docx
users. Users who only have a PDF are directed to open it in Word
(`Fichier > Enregistrer sous > .docx`) and upload the resulting `.docx` —
proven, on this exact document, to give a substantially better outcome
than the native-PDF pipeline ever did, for zero extra engineering.
Automating that conversion server-side (LibreOffice can also do PDF→docx,
but the app's own portable archive lacks the DOCX export filter — it was
only ever packaged for docx→pdf — and LibreOffice's PDF import is
generally considered weaker than Word's, unverified either way here) is a
possible future follow-up, not started.

Kept from this work, now that PDF-origin jobs are gone: nothing code-wise —
`pdf_extract.py`, `pdf_rebuild.py`, `pdf_validate.py`, `pdf_ocr.py`,
`processors/translation_pdf.py`, and the vendored DejaVu Sans font were all
removed. The vision-LLM-OCR pattern from Phase 2 (crop → `call_llm_json`
with an `image_url` content block → JSON transcription) was revived for a
*different*, narrower use case, same session: OCR + translate text baked
into images embedded inside `.docx` files.

**Opt-in docx-embedded-image translation (2026-08-25).**
`server/services/translation/docx_images.py` — an embedded image in a docx
is already a standalone file in the zip (`word/media/imageN.*`), so no
page-rendering/cropping is needed, unlike the PDF work. User-facing flow: a
checkbox on the upload screen, and if checked, the client posts the file to
the new stateless `POST /translate/analyze-images` endpoint and shows a
thumbnail gallery to pick which images to spend an LLM call on. Selected
filenames ride along as a `selected_images` JSON array on the normal job
upload. `_run_job` OCRs just those (best-effort, same failure handling as
the old PDF Phase 2), and each transcription becomes a segment tagged
`location_type='docx_image_ocr'` with the media filename stashed in the
already-existing `xml_choice_path` column (`{"media_filename": ...}` — no
new segment column) and sentinel `body_p_idx=-1`/`para_idx_in_container=-1`
so it can never accidentally satisfy the bilingual-pairing heuristics'
real-paragraph-adjacency checks. Flows through the same audit/translate
pipeline as native text with zero special-casing there.

Restitution deliberately never touches the image's own pixels — direct
lesson from the PDF work: a technical drawing's text is usually scattered
across the whole image (title/paragraph/several boxed labels), not one
caption-friendly spot, and resizing the image to fit an overlay would
distort it inside its existing fixed-size Word frame. Instead,
`insert_image_translations` inserts a plain, immediately-visible italic
paragraph (prefixed `[Traduction]`, real `<w:br/>` line breaks — a literal
`\n` inside `<w:t>` is NOT a line break in OOXML, confirmed the hard way)
right after the paragraph hosting the image's `<w:drawing>`, as a
post-processing pass over the already-rebuilt docx (the XML-position-based
`rebuild_docx_bytes` never sees these segments — split out beforehand,
since `xml_choice_path` holds a media filename here, not a real path).
Scope: raster images only (`.png`/`.jpg`/`.bmp`/`.gif`/`.tiff`) — `.emf`/
`.wmf` vector metafiles are skipped (Pillow can't open them); only
`word/document.xml`'s body is scanned, not headers/footers.

Validated end-to-end (extract → audit → simulated translation → rebuild →
image-paragraph insertion) on `FI F7XC535-3PTS-FI02 indice I.docx` (184
embedded images, the exact document the PDF pipeline failed on): the
synthetic segment survives the audit merge intact, and the output re-opens
cleanly in `python-docx` (an independent OOXML consumer) with the
translated paragraph and its line breaks present. **Not yet tested with a
live vision-LLM call or deployed.**

**Image picker follow-up (2026-08-25), resumed after a session crash.** The
session implementing this got killed mid-work by the local corporate proxy
(`403 Your IT Admin has blocked this request` on `api.anthropic.com`,
categorized as Generative AI risk — a recurring, unexplained block, not
something Claude Code itself can avoid; happens roughly weekly). Recovered
by reading the crashed session's own transcript
(`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`) to find the last
user request and diff it against the working tree's actual state, since the
crash landed mid-edit with no chance to summarize progress.

Three things were asked: (1) detect logos/repeated images by hash to avoid
paying for the same OCR call N times, (2) bigger, more visible thumbnails in
the image-picker UI, (3) never silently drop or blindly reuse the previous
"translate images" selection when restarting a job from scratch. All three
turned out to already be implemented in `docx_images.py`
(`_content_hash`/`repeat_count`, one LLM call per unique hash fanned out to
every filename sharing it) and `TranslateView.tsx` (`ImageGrid`'s
aspect-square grid + repeat badge, `RestartDialog` fetching
`GET /translate/jobs/{id}/images` for `previously_selected`) — the crash hit
right as the last two pieces were being wired together, leaving two loose
ends that made the app **not build**:
- The "Restart from scratch" button still called a `restart` function that
  no longer existed (replaced by `confirmRestart` + `RestartDialog` but the
  button/dialog were never connected) — `tsc` would have failed on this the
  next build, and the button was a runtime `ReferenceError` in the meantime.
- `SegmentsPanel.tsx`'s per-segment image thumbnail had a `setLightbox` on
  click but nothing ever rendered the enlarged view (`lightbox` state
  declared, never read) — part of the same "images not visible enough"
  complaint, just in the review-segments table rather than the upload
  picker.

Both fixed (button now opens `RestartDialog`; a click-to-enlarge overlay
added to `SegmentsPanel.tsx`), `tsc && vite build` and `pytest` both pass
(one unrelated, pre-existing `test_inject_comments_...` failure, untouched
by this session). Hash-based grouping verified with a synthetic docx
(3 byte-identical "logo" images grouped with `repeat_count=3`, two distinct
images at `1`).

Also discovered mid-review: an earlier revision of this same work wrote
`insert_image_translations` (inserts a translated paragraph into the docx
right after the image) but a later comment in `translate.py`'s rebuild stage
reverses that decision — OCR'd image translations now surface **only** in
the Segments panel's "Images" category, never written into the document,
because placement landed unreliably far from the image on documents where
images sit in headers/footers/text boxes. `insert_image_translations` is
therefore dead code now (kept, not deleted — may be worth revisiting rather
than removing outright). **Still not tested against a live vision-LLM call
or deployed**, same as above.

**Follow-up on real usage feedback (job 14, 2026-08-25):** two more fixes
in the same area.
- Image OCR segments were always appended after every real segment
  (`segments.append(...)` in `_run_job`), so they showed up bunched at the
  end of the Segments panel's "Images" category regardless of where the
  image actually sits in the document. `docx_images.py` gained
  `find_image_anchors` (resolves each image's `<a:blip>` up to whichever
  ancestor is a direct child of `<w:body>`, giving the same body-position
  index `extract.py` uses for `body_p_idx` — works for a plain paragraph
  *and* a table cell, since a picture inside a table naturally resolves to
  the table's own body index) and `order_ocr_segments` (splices the image
  segment dicts into the extracted list at that position *before*
  `_insert_segments` runs, so DB `id`/display order reflects it — the
  image segment's own `body_p_idx` field stays the `-1` sentinel
  unchanged, so this has zero effect on `audit.py`'s pairing heuristics).
  Verified against a real python-docx-generated file (image between two
  paragraphs lands correctly between their two segments).
- The Segments panel's "Flagged" tab counted `conflict_flag`, which
  neither the residual-source-language retry nor fit-check CRITICAL
  overflow ever set — so the job-status banner ("N segments still read as
  source language" / "N flagged for text overflow") and the Segments
  panel's own counts disagreed (banner said 3/9, tab said 0). Already
  fixed in `_run_rebuild_stage` (persists `conflict_flag = TRUE` +
  `conflict_detail` for both cases right after rebuild) — **but only for
  jobs rebuilt after this fix landed**; an already-completed job (like job
  14) needs a "Rebuild again" to pick it up, the mismatch isn't retroactive.
- Added "View in document" (an eye icon per segment row, hidden for the
  Images category — those have no document diff, just the lightbox) that
  closes the Segments modal and jumps the Review tab straight to that
  segment's before/after diff (`ReviewPanel`'s new `focusRequest` prop,
  forcing `reviewAll` on first if the segment is invisible to the
  diffs-only view, e.g. a kept/pending one).

Still open, raised in the same feedback round, not yet acted on: whether to
attempt actually redrawing embedded-image pixels with translated text
(style + position preserved) instead of the current app-only surfacing —
recommended against for now, same reasoning as the abandoned PDF
Phase 1/2 pixel work above (no font/style info to work from in a raster
image, high risk of a worse-than-nothing result on a safety-critical
document) — and a broader complaint that the segment category system
(`translated`/`kept_dnt`/`kept_numeric`/`kept_page_filtered`/
`kept_other_language`/`needs_review`/`pending`/`image_translation`/
`flagged`) is getting hard to reason about as more cross-cutting flags pile
on top of it — no concrete redesign proposed yet.

## Segment fidelity bug, deploy, and page-range filter (2026-08-26/27)

**Recurring `segment_fidelity` validation failure, root-caused and fixed.**
A real `latlang-uat` job (16, `subset_FI.docx`) failed rebuild with
`{"segment_fidelity": ["Missing 8 segments vs reference", "Extra 8 segments
vs reference"]}`. Pulled the job's input/output `.docx` straight from the
UC volume and re-ran `extract_docx_segments` on both locally: two
`docx_image_ocr` segments had each gotten a real `[Traduction] ...`
paragraph physically inserted into `word/document.xml`'s body by the (at
the time still-deployed) `insert_image_translations` — and since `seg_id`
is purely positional (`body_p_idx` = index among `<w:body>`'s direct
children), each inserted paragraph shifted every later paragraph's id by
+1, producing exactly matching missing/extra pairs (8 real paragraphs
+ the 2 marker paragraphs themselves, uncounted as "extra" since the
running deploy predated `_check_segment_fidelity_bytes`'s
`IMAGE_TRANSLATION_MARKER` exclusion). Root cause was **stale deployment,
not a code bug**: `insert_image_translations` was already fully
disconnected in the working tree (the 2026-08-25 "images surface only in
Segments panel" decision above) — `latlang-uat` just hadn't been
redeployed since. No code change was needed for this one; deployed the
already-uncommitted working tree (`bundle deploy -t latlang-uat`,
`databricks apps start latlang`) and confirmed the app came back `RUNNING`.

**Validated end-to-end on 4 real "PDF converted to Word" documents**
(`Translator/Sample Docs/*.docx` that exist as both `.pdf` and `.docx`),
driven through the actual deployed API (upload → audit → answer →
translate → rebuild) via a script authenticating with the caller's own
Databricks OAuth token (`Config(profile="uat").authenticate()` — the
CLI's `auth token` subcommand itself gets blocked by the auto-mode
classifier as a credential-generation action, the SDK call underneath
doesn't). All 4 finished `done`/`done_with_warnings`, all 8 structural
checks including `segment_fidelity` passed on every one — including a
1921-segment document. One real finding along the way, unrelated to the
fix: `FI_D5211200300100-OP50_A_STATION2_AVD.p33.docx` extracts **zero**
segments — its `word/document.xml` is a single `<w:drawing>` with no
`<w:t>` at all, i.e. Word's PDF→docx import rasterized a text-less
(scanned) PDF page into one full-page image. The job completes as a
misleadingly clean `done` while translating nothing; the opt-in
docx-image-OCR feature is the only way to get anything out of a document
like this. Not yet fixed (no UI signal for "0 text segments found"), just
surfaced.

**Page-range filter added** (`server/services/translation/pages.py`) — see
the README's own section for the full design (`pages` form field →
`parse_page_spec` → `assign_pages` maps segments to a page number via the
existing LibreOffice-rendered PDF, forward-only text-cursor matching → a
real `out_of_page_range` column on `translation_segments`, deliberately
NOT an overload of `pattern_type` so `audit.py`'s language-mode/pairing
logic stays untouched). Backend tests + frontend build both pass. **Not
yet deployed or tested live** (no local LibreOffice on this machine to
exercise `assign_pages` end-to-end) — next real validation of this needs
another `latlang-uat` deploy.

## Databricks

Bundle name: `latlang`. Targets: `dev`, `latlang-uat`, `latlang-uat-test`,
`latlang-prod`.

- `latlang-uat-test`: disposable test target — own app, own Lakebase
  database (`latlang_test`), own `_test`-suffixed volume, but the UC
  catalog schema itself (`uat_landingzone.latlang`) is shared with
  `latlang-uat` (see Independence above). Deploy/destroy freely — destroying
  it only removes its own volume/jobs/app, never the shared schema.
- `latlang-uat` and `-prod` deploy the real app. Never
  `bundle deploy`/`bundle destroy` on these without explicit user approval
  first, regardless of the global DEV/UAT policy in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- Prefer Asset Bundles (`databricks bundle validate` -> `bundle plan -o json`
  -> `bundle deploy -t <target>`) over ad-hoc API/job calls. Dry-run
  (`plan`) before `deploy`.
- On this machine, `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` is set globally by the VS Code
  Databricks extension's integrated terminal and can silently override
  `--profile` — `unset DATABRICKS_TOKEN` before any `databricks` CLI call.

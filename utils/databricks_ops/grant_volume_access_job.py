# MAGIC One-off admin utility: grants USE CATALOG + USE SCHEMA + READ/WRITE VOLUME
# MAGIC on a single volume to a service principal. Copied from latec-compare's
# MAGIC identical script (same pattern: run_as a service principal that already
# MAGIC has grant authority on the target catalog).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Use case here: declaring a bundle `apps.*.resources` uc_securable block
# MAGIC makes Terraform try to auto-grant USE CATALOG to `account users`, which
# MAGIC fails unless the deploying user has MANAGE on the catalog. This job
# MAGIC grants the app's own service principal directly instead, after the app
# MAGIC has been created without that resources block.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If `run_as` also lacks GRANT rights on the target catalog, this job fails
# MAGIC with the same PERMISSION_DENIED the target service principal hits — a job
# MAGIC can't manufacture a privilege `run_as` doesn't already have.
